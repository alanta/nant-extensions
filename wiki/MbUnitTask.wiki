#summary NAnt task for MbUnit with TeamCity support.

= Introduction =
TeamCity currently does not support the MbUnit test framework out of the box. This task integrates MbUnit test results into the TeamCity build results.
The task is based on the NAnt task that comes with MbUnit, but extended to check if it is running within a TeamCity build. If so, the task will output test results to TeamCity. The test results will show up in the project statistics. Detailed test results (stack traces, exception information etc.) is also available.

= Known issues =
Due to the way MbUnit logs it's test results the timing information for the tests shown by TeamCity 3.x is not valid. TeamCity 4.x (not released yet) will support timing information.
